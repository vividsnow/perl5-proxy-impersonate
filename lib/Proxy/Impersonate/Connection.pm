=head1 NAME

Proxy::Impersonate::Connection - one client connection's state machine

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One instance per client connection, created by L<Proxy::Impersonate> on accept.
Reads a plaintext proxy request or a C<CONNECT>, terminates TLS for the latter
with L<Proxy::Impersonate::Cert>, then forwards each request upstream through
the shared L<Curl::Impersonate> multi handle and streams the response back --
with backpressure, so a slow client cannot make the proxy buffer without bound.
You do not normally touch it directly.

The C<on_request> hook documented in L<Proxy::Impersonate/new> fires here, in
C<_forward>: after TLS termination and before anything goes upstream, which is
the only point where the request exists in plaintext and is still changeable.
